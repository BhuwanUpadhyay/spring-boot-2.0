# Spring Boot 2.0

Spring is one of the best frameworks on the market for developing web, enterprise, and cloud-ready software. Spring Boot simplifies the building of complex software dramatically by reducing the amount of boilerplate code, and by providing production-ready features and a simplified deployment model.



### Features <a id="features"></a>

* Create stand-alone Spring applications
* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly \(no need to deploy WAR files\)
* Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
* Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
